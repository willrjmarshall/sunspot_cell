= Sunspot Cell for Dragonfly

This plugin adds Cell support (for indexing rich documents) to Sunspot (developed against Sunspot 1.2.1).

The code is based on the patch included here:
http://outoftime.lighthouseapp.com/projects/20339/tickets/98-solr-cell

== Requirements

* Solr Cell libraries (+dist/apache-solr-cell-1.4.X.jar+ and +contrib/extraction/lib/*.jar+ from the standard Solr distribution) placed in the +/solr/lib+ directory as created by the Sunspot gem, in development environment. Your production setup might vary.

* Adjustments to the Solr +schema.xml+:

	<fieldType name="ignored" stored="false" indexed="false" multiValued="true" class="solr.StrField" />
	
and
	
	<dynamicField name="*_attachment" stored="true" type="text" multiValued="true" indexed="true"/>
	<dynamicField name="ignored_*" type="ignored"/>

== Note

This version expects data to be modelled as per Dragonfly attachments.

== Usage

In your searchable block within your model add the document content attribute as an "attachment" type:

  searchable do
    attachment :document_attachment
    ...
  end

The plugin will expect a method to be defined that matches the name of the attachment attribute in our example it would be "document_attachment", e.g.

  def document_attachment
    File.read(fname) # Reading contents from a file, you can also supply the contents direct from a DB field
  end

== Todo

* Tests

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
